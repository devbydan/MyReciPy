    "Preheat the oven to 250°F/120°C (all oven types). Put one oven shelf in the lower quarter of the oven and one in the top quarter.",
    "Line the tray with foil. Put a rack on the tray then spray the rack with oil.",
    "Toss wings – Place the wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle over baking powder and salt. Use hands to toss well (or shake in ziplock bag) to coat wings evenly.",
    "Bake 30 minutes on low temp – Place the wings skin side up on the rack (ok if snug, they shrink). Bake on the lower shelf in the oven for 30 minutes.",
    "Bake 40 minutes on high – Move the tray up to the higher shelf and turn the oven up to 425°F / 220°C (all oven types). Bake for a further 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the tray halfway through. The wings do not need to be turned over. They are ready when dark golden brown and the skin is very crispy.",
    "Toss in sauce – Transfer the wings into a large bowl. Pour over sauce and toss to coat. (Alternatively, serve wings plain with Buffalo Sauce for dipping).",
    "Serve immediately with Blue Cheese Dip (for both wings and celery sticks dunking)!",

    "Sauté aromatics – Heat oil over medium high in a heavy based pot. Cook the onion, garlic and capsicum for 3 minutes.",
    "Brown beef – Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, until you no longer see raw meat. Add tomato paste and stir for 1 minute.",
    "Sauce – Add the spices, tomato, water, crumbled beef cube and salt. Stir well.",
    "Slow cook 3 hours –  Bring the chili to a simmer then turn down to low, on a small burner. Put the lid partially on (to allow for sauce reduction). Simmer for 3 hours on low (goal: small bubble every now and then), stirring just to ensure the base doesn’t catch. OR put it in a 160°C/325°F oven for 3 hours (lid partially cracked).",
    "Slow cooker (Note 4) – Reduce water to 3/4 cup. After chili comes to a simmer on the stove, transfer everything to a slow cooker then cook on low for 6 to 8 hours on low.",
    "Thicken sauce – Remove 1 1/2 cups of the chili into a container so the head of a stick blender will be submerged under the chili. Then blitz until smooth (~ 15 seconds). Add the pureed sauce back in the pot and stir well.",
    "Sauce goal – As you stir, the remaining beef bits should become quite fine (rather than bolognese type chunks) because the beef is so tender. If the beef bits are not as small as desired, use a potato masher in the pot – it won't take long. The chili sauce should be a thick sauce that mounds up a bit when you scoop it, not runny. (Note 5) Keep sauce warm.",
    "Optional rest overnight – Allow the sauce to cool then refrigerate overnight. As with most slow-cooked stewy things, the flavour improves! Reheat on the stove before proceeding.",
    "Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan).",
    "Grill/pan-fry – Preheat a pan with 1/2 tbsp oil (or the BBQ) on medium / medium high. Brown the stages all over until they are heated through (they are already cooked inside, it's just about heating/colour).",
    "Assemble – Place hot dog buns on a tray. Stuff with a sausage, top with a squiggle of mustard and a sprinkle of onion. Spoon over a generous amount of warm chili sauce, top with cheese.",
    "Bake for 7 to 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Serve immediately. Traditionally with a mound of plain crinkle cut potato chips and an ice cold beer!"

    "Brush / spoon half the glaze all over the surface and cut face of the ham (don't worry about underside, glaze drips down into pan)",

    "Allow to rest for at least 20 minutes before serving. Baste, baste, baste before serving – as the glaze in the pan cools, it thickens which means it \"paints\" the ham even better – but be sure to save pan juices for drizzling.",
    "My favourite sauce: Use pan juices as the sauce – it's loaded with flavour! Pour into a jug and warm so it's pourable. Thin slightly with water if required. Drizzle sparingly as the glaze flavour is intense!",
    "Other condiments: Dijon mustard, wholegrain mustard, onion jam, tomato chutney, cranberry sauce.",
    "Presentation: Wrap handle with baking paper and ribbon if desired. Remove cloves. Cover serving platter with lots of green fluffage, then place ham on. Surround with more quartered oranges, for colour. Let people admire before carving!",

    "Leftovers: See list in post for recipe using leftover ham and ham bone!",
    "Storing: Will keep for at least a week in the fridge if properly stored using a water-vinegar soaked ham bag or pillowcase. Otherwise freeze – don't forget the bone! See How to Store Glazed Ham for directions."

Place over medium low heat, stirring constantly so the base doesn't catch, until it starts to thicken (you will feel it). It should happen within 3 to 5 minutes. If it gets lumpy, remove off heat, whisk vigorously – will become smooth.",

    "Bake 65 minutes, rotating tray 180° at 45 minutes. It will puff up in the last 15 ninutes like a souffle. Remove from oven – it will still be very wobbly, have faith! It will set when cool!Golden surface – If the top is not golden like pictured, switch on broiler to caramelise surface. Watch carefully – takes minutes!",
    "Cool on counter for 4 hours (in pan). Transfer to plate (still in pan), cover loosely with cling wrap, then refrigerate 12+ hours.",
    "Serve: Remove from fridge 1 hour prior to serving to bring to room temperature. Cut into slices like cake! The pastry is crispy & flaky. The custard will cut neatly (it will not ooze) but when you bite into it, the custard is beautifully soft and creamy. Traditionally eaten as a hand held bakery treat in France but you can use a plate if you're feeling civilised!",
    "Shelf life: Flan Pâtissier is at its best in the first 24 hours after it is put in the fridge after baking as this is when the pastry is still beautifully crisp. Beyond this the pastry starts to soften which no one has pointed out yet because everyone is besotted by the custard! But I notice. 🙂"

    "Fill pot: Place all the chicken stock ingredients into a large stockpot (7 litre / 7 quarts+). Fill with 3 litres / 3 quarts of cold water, which should just about cover the bones. (Note 3)",
    "Scoop off scum: Bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Scoop off and discard any foam that collects on the surface using a ladle (this helps make stock clear).",
    "Simmer 3 hours: Turn stove down to low and simmer for 3 hours with no lid. The stove should be low enough so the surface is barely rippling and you just get a gentle bubble every now and then. Too rapid boiling = murky stock.",
    "Strain: Using a lid to hold the bones and vegetables in the pot, pour the stock through a fine sieve into another pot or large bowl. (Alternatively, scoop out the solids first with a slotted spoon and then strain.)",

    "Fill jars/containers: Measure out into containers for storage and faster cooling. (I do multiples of 1 cup)",

    "FROSTING – cream butter: Beat butter with either a handheld beater or stand mixer (with whisk attachment) for 3 minutes until it's smooth and changes from yellow to very pale yellow, almost white.",
    "FROSTING – add roux: While beating on speed 5, add the roux one heaped tablespoon at a time. Take about 1 minute to add it all. Once all added, add lemon zest and juice, then whip for 2 minutes until you can see that it is stiff enough to hold peaks liek whipped cream. Do not whip more than 4 to 5 minutes (this will activate starch and make it sticky).",

    "The crust will be delicately crusty and flake gently when you slice it. It will be ultra soft inside, much softer than usual breads, with a pale yellow colour from the butter and eggs. Though traditionally sliced to serve, a unique characteristic is that if you tear the bread, it shreds like cotton candy. This is the sign off a well made traditional French brioche that you will not find in run-of-the-mill grocery store cheap brioche!

    "Prick skin: Poke lots of small holes all over the pork knuckle’s skin, using a small sharp knife or even a pin (eg. safety pin, sewing pin). Take care not to pierce through the fat into the flesh (Note 7).",
    "Vinegar: Brush (or rub) 1 tbsp of the vinegar on the pork flesh only, including inside cracks / crevices and meat under the skin where it meets the flesh (but do not peel skin back). Avoid getting vinegar on the skin.",
    "Stud with garlic: Make shallow incisions in the pork flesh (only) with a small knife then stuff with the garlic slivers.",
    "Seasoning rub: Pound the rub ingredients in a mortar and pestle until it's a coarse powder (or use a Nutribullet, spice grinder or similar).",
    "Rub seasoning on pork: Rub pork skin with olive oil. Then rub the seasoning mix all over the pork – on the flesh, skin, and getting into all the cracks and crevices.",
    "Skewer skin (secret for crispy skin! Note 8): Pull the skin down to stretch it tight so there's no creases. Then thread through 2 metal skewers in a \"X\" formation near the base of the knuckle. Pierce through skin 2cm / 0.8\" from the base of the pork knuckle to hold the stretched skin in place.",
    "\"Marinate\" overnight: Place pork standing on a plate, then leave uncovered in the fridge overnight (Note 9).",

    "Beer gravy: Put all beer gravy ingredients in a roasting pan (deep enough to hold all liquids and vegetables).",
    "Rack on pan: Place a rack over the pan. Place pork knuckle on rack, sitting upright. (Note 10)",
    "Slow roast: Roast for 2 hours 10 minutes, rotating tray half way. (If the liquid in the pan is getting too low and in danger of drying out, top with 1/2 cup of water at a time.) Roast until the internal temperature in the thickest part of meat reaches 85°C / 185°F.",
    "Remove knuckle from oven, transfer knuckle to a tray.",
    "Increase oven: Increase oven to 260°C / 500°F (240°C fan) (Note 11)",
    "Brush skin with vinegar: Brush skin with 1/2 the remaining 1 tbsp of vinegar. Place in oven for 30 minutes, rotating tray halfway and brushing with remaining vinegar.",
    "Skin should be crispy, dip golden and mostly bubbly.",
    "Rest: Rest 15 minutes before serving with German Beer Gravy!",
    "Strain liquid: Strain roasting pan juices into a saucepan. Ideally you should have around 1.5 – 2 cups.",
    "Thicken: Bring liquid to a simmer. Mix cornflour and water, then pour into liquid while stirring. Add sugar and salt to taste.",
    "Simmer: Simmer for 2 minutes or until it becomes a thin syrup consistency (German beer gravy should not be as thick as normal gravy, but quite runny). If it's too thick, add a touch of water. Too thin, simmer to reduce – it will thicken. Serve with pork knuckle!"

    "Preparation: Preheat oven to 130°C/265°F (120°C fan). Place 4 x ⅔ cup / 150 ml empty ramekins in a baking pan with high enough sides that enough water can be poured in to come halfway up ramekins.",
    "Boil water: Boil a kettle of water.",
    "Whisk egg yolks and sugar: Whisk yolks and sugar until just well combined. Don't whisk too much, as this can create bubbles.",
    "Add cream: Pour cream into eggs and gently stir to combine. Divide mixture between ramekins with a soup ladle.",
    "Water bath: Pour in enough boiling water so it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. (If you have too much water, ramekins will float around – not good!)",
    "Bake: Bake for 35 – 40 minutes, or until the custard is set but there is still a slight wobble when you GENTLY give the ramekin a little shake.",
    "Chill: Remove ramekins from water. Leave to cool, then refrigerate for at least 6 hours and preferably overnight (up to 3 days is OK).",
    "Blow torch method: Sprinkle 1/2 tsp sugar over the surface of each crème brûlée. Use a blow torch to melt and caramelise the sugar. Serve immediately.",
    "Grill / broiler method: Crème brûlée should be first refrigerated overnight. Preheat grill to high. Place crème brûlée under grill for 1 minute or until sugar is melted and caramelised. Refrigerate afterwards for at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour (to reset custard immediately under toffee), then serve.",
    "Crème brûlée perfect texture: The texture should be like a very thick yogurt, rather than set so it is sliceable like cake or even like a soft set jelly. When you take a scoop, the custard should barely hold together, but shouldn't be melting or running. When you take a bite the custard should literally just melt in your mouth."

Add more water if needed, to just cover the bones (ingredients will collapse a bit as stock cooks). The water quantity depends on shape of bone and pot –  my water level came to 5.75 litres/quarts mark on pot.",
    "Boil then simmer: Bring to a boil on medium high, then turn down to low so it's simmering ever so gently, with only a small bubble bursting every now and then.",

    "Strain: Fish out most bones. Strain stock with remaining vegetables through a fine mesh colander / strainer set over a large pot or bowl. Leave strainer for a few minutes to let it drip.",

    "Salt adjustment: Homemade stock is unsalted whereas store-bought stock is salted. Add 1/4 tsp salt for every 1 cup homemade beef stock (250ml) to match the salt level of store-bought low sodium beef stock.",
    "To use: Cold stock has a jellied consistency (Note 4). It takes barely a minute to turn liquid on a medium high stove, or microwave. You can also just add it in jelly form straight into dishes, but sometimes you may need to liquify it to measure."

    "Season flesh: Sprinkle pork flesh with 1 1/2 tsp salt, all the pepper and all fennel seeds and 1 tbsp olive oil. Rub into flesh, right into all the crevices and cracks.",
    "Salt skin: Flip pork, drizzle skin with 1 tsp oil, then rub all over with fingers. Sprinkle all over with remaining 1 1/2 tsp salt, taking care to get even coverage. Un-salted patches will not become bubbly crackling, it will be a hard flat sheet.",
    "Garlic & onion bed: Place halved garlic bulbs and onion in roasting pan. Place pork skin side up on top of them.",

    "Slow roast: Roast for 2 1/2 hours.",
    "Level at 1 1/2 hours: Check pork after 1 1/2 hours to see if the pork is warped and the skin's overall surface is significantly unlevelled. If so, adjust to make the skin surface as level as possible using balls of foil and moving large dislodged pork pieces to the side (key tip for crispy crackling, Note 3). Then return to oven for the remaining 1 hour.",
    "Check pan & salt on skin:  If pan is drying out, add some water. If there are bald patches on the skin without salt (eg it fell off), spray lightly with oil spray (or brush lightly with oil) then sprinkle with salt. (Remember, salt = bubbly skin!)",
    "Increase heat: Turn oven up to 250°C/485°F (all oven types), or as high as it will go if your oven won't go this high.",
    "Make skin crisp: Return pork to oven for 30 minutes, rotating pan as needed, until skin is crisp and bubbly all over. If needed, use foil patches, secured with water soaked toothpicks, to cover parts that are done and keep crisping up remaining patches.",
    "Rest: Transfer pork to serving platter, tent loosely with foil (don't worry, crackling stays super-crisp) and rest for 20 minutes (stays warm up to 1 hour). Then slice using a serrated knife.",

    "Gravy roux: Heat the saucepan with the fat over medium heat. Add flour and cook for 1 minute.",
    "Add liquids: Pour stock in while whisking so it's lump free. Then pour in strained pan juies.",
    "Thicken: Simmer until thickened to syrup consistency – about 3 minutes – it will thicken more as it cools a little while serving. (Note 4 for colour tip)",
    "Season: Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Pour into serving jug. Serve with pork."

    "Beat 6 min: Beat for a further 6 minutes (still on Speed 8) until thick, glossy and no sugar grains remain (rub between fingers to check).",
    "Add cornflour & vinegar: Stop beater, sift cornflour over surface. Add vinegar. Beat on speed 8 for a further 30 seconds.",

    "Cool 3 hours IN oven: Turn oven off. Leave pavlova to fully cool in oven, at least 3 hours, maybe longer. I often leave overnight. In this step, the outside of pav dries out and becomes more sturdy. The pav should be fully crisp and dry to touch.",
    "Store until needed in airtight containers, in a cool, dry part of your house (I keep mine in the downstairs laundry! Note 9)",

    "Place cream, vanilla and sugar in a large chilled bowl. Beat on high for 5 minutes until stiff. (Go beyond soft, lightly whipped, we need the structure!). Refrigerate until the very moment until you start buildling.",

    "Layer 1: Place largest Pavlova Round on serving platter. Spread with 1cm / 2/5\" thick layer of cream, right to the edge. Place 4 strawberry pillars around the edge, onto which the next layer will rest. Gently press them into the cream so they rest on the pav surface. Scatter some chopped strawberries in the middle of the pillars – not too many as we do not want to weigh the pav down. Drizzle with raspberry coulis, especially near the edge so it oozes out prettily. Spread with a bit more cream to cover the strawberries – make sure the cream is level for the next layer. Stick a skewer into the centre, pointy end up.",
    "Layer 2: Thread the centre of the next largest Pavlova Round onto the skewer, spinning back and forth gently to \"screw\" it through rather than pushing it through. It won't shatter – pav is tougher than you think. Repeat the cream, strawberry pillars, strawberry dice, coulis and cream steps above.",
    "Repeat Layers 3 to 7: Continue this with layers 3 to 7, finishing with the smallest meringue. You will only need 2 strawberry pillars on the smaller layers, and 1 under the centre of the smallest. If the skewer isn't long enough, thread through another one for the upper part of the tree. With each layer, check that the tree is straight and level. Use strawberries to level up the layers.",
    "Star topper: When the smallest Pavlova is placed on the very top, finish with a dollop of cream, small drizzle of coulis. Then insert the star, plus a raspberry and sprig or rosemary!",
    "Decorate with sprigs of rosemary, and insert raspberries onto the edges between layers (halve if necessary, to fit), using them to level out crooked layers, if needed.",
    "Dust with icing sugar and then serve immediately!",
    "The top 2 layers are single serving size. The next 2 layers will serve 2 people each. The bottom 4 layers can be cut like traditional Pavs and will easily serve another 8 – 10 people."

    "After the ganache is smooth and level, refrigerate for at least 1 hour before coating with Mirror Glaze.",
    "Bloom gelatine: Place water in a small bowl. Then sprinkle gelatine across surface, mix just so all the powder is wet. Leave for 5 minutes – it will become like a rubber consistency. (This is called \"blooming gelatine\".)",
    "Whisk cocoa and water: Place cocoa and water in a medium saucepan then mix until virtually lump-free. It will be like a paste.",
    "Add cream and sugar: Add a splash of cream to cocoa mix and stir. It will loosen up. Add remaining cream and sugar, then GENTLY continue to mix to combine. Do not mix vigorously and do not use a whisk (Note 7).",
    "Bring glaze to boil: Turn stove onto medium high heat. As soon as it comes to the boil, remove from the stove.",
    "Dissolve gelatine: Add gelatine lump, then GENTLY stir until it dissolves and you have a smooth glossy glaze. (There may be some white foam, that's ok.)",
    "First straining: Using a shallow bowl and small fine mesh strainer, strain the glaze into a bowl. Pour and position the strainer so the glaze falls the smallest distance possible. If you pour from a height, this creates bubbles = bad!",
    "Bubble check: Twist the bowl back and forth between your hands rapidly. This will make any bubbles rise and gather in the centre. If you see bubbles, see \"Note 8: Bubble Troubleshooting\".",
    "Cool glaze: Cover with cling wrap, pressing the cling wrap onto the surface of the glaze to prevent a skin from forming. Cool on the counter for 2 hours until it reaches 30°C/86°F. See Note 9 for overnight refrigeration.",
    "Second straining: Just before pouring over the cake, strain the glaze into a jug. As before, tilt the jug and strainer as you pour the glaze in to minimise the distance the glaze falls.",
    "Transfer cake to rack: Remove cake from fridge, transfer onto a rack. (See Note 9 for how I do it.) Place rack on a tray to catch excess glaze.",
    "Pour over mirror glaze: Starting at the centre of the cake, pour the glaze on, moving in an expanding spiral motion gradually towards the outer edge of the cake, to make the glaze spread across the surface and drape like curtain down the sides. For the most perfect surface, try to do it in one motion without breaking the pour. Pour with confidence in a thick stream rather than a thin drizzle (which might set too quick and leave drips).",
    "Ensure all sides are fully coated – if not, quickly do a little pour down the sides to coat the naked patches.",
    "Transfer cake to platter: Before the mirror glaze sets (takes ~10 minutes), move the cake to a cake platter (Note 9 again for my cake-shifting method).",
    "Fix blemishes – Use excess glaze on the tray and in the jug to fill gaps and tears. Then smooth over with a warmed palette knife (either lightly warm with a blow torch or dip into warm water and wipe). See video for demo.",
    "Fill a tall jug with warm tap water. Dip a knife in, then wipe dry. Make one slice into the cake.",
    "Clean knife, dip in warm water and dry again. Make your second cut to get your wedge. Pull wedge out and marvel at the perfect layers before continuing to cut more slices! See notes for storage."

    "Troubleshooting: If your ganache splits (ie. oil streaks) or is grainy, or it's too thick or thin, see above in post for how to fix these problems.",
    "Cooling: If cooling your ganache (to spread, pipe or whip), cool it uncovered for 30 minutes. Then cover with cling wrap and press so it contacts the surface (so you don't get a skin forming) and continue to cool.",
    "Pourable / dipping sauce / pour glaze – allow to cool for 15 minutes on the counter until it's still runny but pourable. Use as required – pour over cakes as a thick chocolate glaze, over sundaes, into bowls to use for dipping, or to make drip decorations.",

    "Flatten dough into a disc, wrap in cling wrap and place in the fridge for 1 1/2 hours. (Note 2)",
    "Remove dough from fridge. For ease of handling, cut the dough into 2 pieces. Use a rolling pin to roll out to 3mm / 1/ 10\" thickness between two pieces of baking (parchment) paper. See Note 3 for an easy way to do this.",

    "On Square B, use a knife to spread melted chocolate on the right edge you trimmed. Then attach that to another square, then repeat until you have constructed the walls of a box. Repeat for other box.",
    "While the walls are setting, get two more squares. Trim them with a knife so they are the right size to fit inside the walls - this will be the Base of the box. Spread a little chocolate on the edges of the square then pick up the walls and put it over the Base and push down so the Base fits inside the walls.",

    "Lay the rectangle from step 4 on the dough and use a large knife to cut out the rectangle. Repeat to make two rectangles.",
    "Leaving the dough on the baking paper it was rolled out on, place the can on one end of the dough and roll up firmly to cover the can. Make sure it wraps snugly, saggy dough will result in a saggy Mason Jar. Remove parchment paper, trim any excess dough and use your fingers to seal. Repeat with other can. Place the cans on their side on the baking tray, seam side down.",
    "Gather up the dough remnants and roll out again. Place one can with the dough wrapped around it upright onto the dough and use a small knife to cut out rounds. Repeat to make 2 rounds. These will be the lids. Place onto baking tray.",
    "Optional: Cut a small square and place in the centre of the lids. (I forgot to do this and had to stick on a cooked piece of gingerbread!)",
    "Place baking tray in the fridge with the cans on their side for 30 minutes. This helps stop the mason jars from sliding down when baking.",
    "Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Put the oven shelf in the middle of your oven (note 5).",
    "Remove the baking tray from the fridge. If the dough on the cans has sagged slightly, use your hands to press it against the can.",
    "Turn the cans upright on the baking tray and place the tray into the oven.",
    "Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until golden brown, turning the tray halfway through (so the mason jar bakes an even colour).",
    "Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.",
    "Once cool, gently pull the can and baking paper out of the Mason Jar. It should slip out fairly easily, if not, just twist it slightly to loosen then pull out.",
    "Fit the small circles into the base of the Mason Jar. It might need trimming to fit - be careful not to over trim, you want it to fit snugly. You do not need anything to make it stay in place because the gingerbread is sticky and the base should fit snugly.",
    "Decorating is optional. With a ribbon, I don't think any decorations are required. On one, I piped Royal Icing along the bottom, top and rim with Silver Sugar Balls.",
    "Use a mixer to beat the egg white until soft peaks form. Gradually add icing sugar, a heaped dessert spoon at a time, making sure it is incorporated before adding the next tablespoon.",
    "Transfer the Royal Icing into a piping bag with tip of choice.",
    "Use to decorate the Boxes and Mason Jar, as desired.",

  "ingredients": [
    "2 kg / 4 lbs meaty pork ribs",
    "1 tsp sesame oil",
    "2 tbsp lemon juice",
    "2 tbsp shao xing wine",
    "4 tbsp soy sauce",
    "4 tbsp brown sugar or honey",
    "4 tbsp tomato sauce or ketchup",
    "2 tbsp hoisin sauce",
    "2 tbsp oyster sauce",
    "2 tbsp sambal oelek",
    "6 cloves garlic",
    "2 tbsp grated ginger",
    "1 tsp Chinese five spice powder",

  ],
  "directions": [
    "Mix marinade ingredients together in a bowl or freezer bag. Add the ribs and marinate for at least an hour, or overnight if possible. You can freeze the marinaded meat if you wish.",
    "Before cooking, let the ribs come to room temperature.",
    "Preheat the oven to 160C/320F.",
    "Pour the ribs and all the marinade into a baking dish large enough so the ribs are in a single layer, but not so large that they are too spread out.",
    "Add water up to about 1/3 of the way up the ribs. 6 Cover tightly with foil and place in oven to cook for approximately 1.5 hours.",
    "Take out of the oven, remove the foil and touch the ribs – they should be quite tender, but not falling off the bone. The marinade in the baking dish should still be quite watery.",
    "Turn the ribs over, then return the baking dish to the oven without the foil. After 20 minutes, take the ribs out – they should be nicely browned and starting to char. Turn the ribs, then spoon the marinade over, then return to the oven for another 10 to 20 minutes.",
    "The ribs are done when they are falling off the bone, sticky and glossy and the marinade has reduced down to a thick sauce coating the ribs.",
    "Rest for 5 minutes. Garnish with coriander, sesame seeds, julienned shallots and sliced fresh red chilli."
