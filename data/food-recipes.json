    "Preheat the oven to 375°F.",
    "Lightly oil (always use olive oil!) a 12 inch in diameter, metal baking pan (you can use a larger baking pan - you will just have a thinner pita, but don't use a smaller one), or a 10 x 15 inch rectangular baking pan.",
    "Add dill and feta cheese to the spinach.  Add salt and pepper to taste (careful with the salt - the feta will add quite a bit of its own).   Pour the eggs over and give a stir to combine well.",
    "Open up the phyllo pastry and place on a work surface.  If using the country style pastry proceed, if using the thinner phyllo; cover with a damp cloth.  (Continue to cover the pastry sheets with the damp cloth each time you remove one as you prepare the pie.).",
    "Layer the phyllo in the pan, allowing the edges to hang over the sides of the pan, brushing each phyllo layer generously with olive oil.",
    "Use up half the phyllo sheets to make the bottom pastry layer, allowing excess pastry to drape over edge of pan.",
    "Put the spinach mixture in and press the top down gently to smooth filling.  Tuck in the pastry draping over the edges.",
    "Repeat layering with the remaining phyllo, oiling each sheet generously.",
    "Using a sharp knife, score the upper layers of pastry into the size pieces you will want to serve once the pie is baked- BE CAREFUL NOT TO CUT THROUGH BOTTOM PASTRY.",
    "Bake the pie in the middle of the oven for approximately 40-45 minutes until it is golden brown.   For the last 15-20 minutes, I put my baking pan directly on the oven floor to crisp it better.",
    "Cool till just warm (we never, but never eat this hot! The flavours just wouldn't come through properly).   Cut into serving pieces and serve either just warm or at room temperature.",
    "Note:  If my spinach filling appears to be too 'wet', I often take 2 of the phyllo sheets and use them as a 'layer' between the spinach filling; these sheets absorb the extra liquid (they must not be brushed with oil).",
    "It's also worth noting that Greeks love their olive oil!  I have used olive oil with a lighter hand than most Greeks in this recipe - but it may still be too much for you.  Feel free to add the amount you feel most comfortable with, but be aware that flavour may be compromised."

    "Heat oil in heavy bottomed ovensafe 12 inch straight sided sautee pan or Dutch oven with tight fitting lid over low-medium heat about 2 minutes. (The recipe is very specific about this but I used a 10 inch dutch oven and it worked out fine.) Drop a few rice grains in and if they sizzle then it is ready. Add rice and fry stirring until rice is light golden and translucent, about 6-8 minutes.  Be careful that the oil doesn't get too hot too fast or the oil will splatter.",

    "Stir in cilantro, minced jalapeno to taste, and pass lime wedges separately.",
    "Edited to add 6-15-05: If you can't get good fresh tomatoes you are better off using canned tomatoes. Don't use those awful hard and underipe tomatoes that are at most supermarket chains. Just be sure that the processed tomatoes and the one onion equals 2 cups. One the other hand- if you find that after processing your tomatoes and onions that you have less than 2 cups- simply add enough bottled salsa to make up the difference.",
    "Edited 8-21-06: Do not skip any of the steps. It may seem stupid- but rinsing the rice to remove the starch is very important if you want fluffy rice. It will only take two minutes of your time but it makes the difference.",
    "Edited 8-15-08: Leftovers are just as delicious the next day so this is a perfect dish to make ahead time for potlucks. This rice also freezes well. For Freezing Ahead: Cool, portion and freeze in a ziploc bag. To reheat from frozen: Place in a pyrex dish and warm in the microwave, stirring every 2-3 minutes until heated through.",

If you do not have a sifter, use a spoon to spoon the flour into the 1 cup measure. Try it once the \"correct\" way and you will see an amazing difference in the end product.",

    "In a medium bowl, beat butter, shortening, sugar and vanilla until creamy. Add chilled milk and flour mixture and beat for 10 minutes. Frost cooled cake and enjoy! The frosting sounds intimidating, but it is worth it! By the way, for some reason, we prefer this cake chilled, right out of the refrigerator. The rich chocolate and cool frosting just seem to taste best this way."

    "This bar comes together rather quickly. Begin by preparing a 9 by 9 inch pan with a good coating of cooking spray and set aside.  Also apply a bit of spray to your cooking spoon (preferably wooden).",
    "If your almonds are not already toasted, place them in a dry non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, routinely tossing the almonds around the pan. The almonds should add just a small amount of color and become slightly aromatic.",
    "To make the bars, begin by adding the butter and brown sugar together in a large sauce pan over medium to low heat. Stir while the both the butter and sugar melt for 2 minutes or so.  The result is smooth to the feel with a wooden spoon.  In addition, you should be able to move  it about the bottom of the pan with the spoon (sort of a blob).",
    "Add in the 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and stir.",
    "Add the miniature marshmallows and stir continuously helping the puffs to melt. Continue mixing until you have a pale brown mixture that is still rather loose.",
    "This is where things begin to move fast.  Once the marshmallows are fully melted and mixed with the sugar, add in the Rice Krispies, almonds and apricots. Stir quickly to get all of the ingredients incorporated.",
    "Turn the mixture out into the 9 by 9 inch pan, distributing as much as possible using your spoon.",
    "To level the bars in the pan, give your palms a quick shot of cooking spray and pat down.",
    "Place the bars in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to set.",
    "Invert pan and give the pan a good whack to release the Krispies bar.  Slice into 12 pieces (4 by 3).",
    "Melt white chocolate chips in a double boiler over very low heat.  (If you do not have a double boiler, you can fashion one using a large bowl over a smaller saucepan. Just be certain the fit is tight and no steam is being released).",
    "Add the oil to the chocolate and stir while the the chips continue to melt.  If the chocolate begins to harden, this is sign the heat is too high and you should lower the flame or remove the top half of the double boiler from the bottom.",
    "Stir the Grand Marnier into the melted chocolate and use a spoon to stripe the bars on the diagonal allowing the melted chocolate to drip down the side.  If you are a big fan of white chocolate, you can skip the drizzling and just dunk the bars into the white chocolate and place on waxed paper to cool.",
    "(Timesaver tip:  If you want to speed things up a bit.  You can melt the chocolate after placing the bars in the pan and drizzle over the entire pan before cooling and cutting.  Not quite as pretty, but just as tasty)."

    "MAKE THE COOKAROLIS: Cut cookie dough in half lengthwise and place onto a long sheet of plastic wrap (about 2 feet). Place one half of the dough into the center, then place another sheet of plastic wrap loosely over top. Roll out cookie dough into a 4\" wide strip 1/4\" thick. Lift off top sheet of plastic wrap and discard. Place 3-4 chocolate morsels in a group onto the bottom of cookie strip 1/2\" apart.",

Holding the ends of the plastic wrap taut, place the strips onto a cookie sheet and freeze till needed. Repeat with the other half of cookie dough.",
    "MAKE THE PASTRY DOUGH: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Pulse for a few seconds and then pour into a large mixing bowl.",
    "Add the shortening and knead it into the flour with your hands until it is crumbly. Add the milk all at once and mix in with a spatula until it begins to come together.",
    "Lightly flour your hands and the countertop and turn the dough out onto the countertop. Knead the dough ball, folding over about 12 times. Divide dough in half. Roll each half out to 6\" wide strips and about 1/8\" thin.",
    "Remove cookarolis from the freezer and separate them into individual pieces using a knife or pizza pie cutter. Place cookarolis onto the dough 1/4\" apart on the bottom half of the dough. Brush the edges of half of the dough lightly with the egg wash (remember egg wash sticks to dough, but not itself). Fold top part of dough over and separate (using a pizza cutter works well) and then gently seal the edges together with the tines of a fork, dipping the tines into some flour as needed. Repeat with second ball of dough. Place on cookie sheet and refridgerate for a minimum of 30 minutes. NOTE: at this point, they can be frozen on the cookie sheets, then placed into a ziploc bag and frozen for up to a year till needed.",
    "DEEP FRY: Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350°F Carefully fry in batches for about 3 minutes until just light brown. Drain on paper towels. When cooled (about 5 minutes), dust with powdered sugar. Serve immidiately but be careful, as filling may still be hot."

Whisk the cocoa/sugar/salt combo into the melted butter until the sugar has dissolved fully. The mixture should look like fudge and pull away from the bowl into a ball. Take off the stove and set the pan on a dishtowel on your counter. Allow the fudgy mixture to cool down until it's warm, but not hot anymore.",
    "While that is cooling, line the bottom and sides of your 9 by 13-inch baking pan with parchment paper or foil. You want to leave about 4 inches of overhang on the 2 opposite sides. These serve as your handles to remove the brownies from the pan in 1 piece, so make sure that there is enough of the overhang for you to have a solid grip. Grease the parchment or foil well.",
    "Stir in the vanilla into the cooled fudge mixture to loosen it up. Add the eggs into the mixture 1 at a time, adding the second egg after the first egg is fully incorporated. The batter should look shiny and well blended. Add in your flour and stir it until it's fully incorporated. Once it looks fully blended, beat the batter vigorously for at least 45 strokes. This'll not only get out any pent up stress, but it will make the brownies chewy. Fold in your chocolate chips. Spread the very thick and fudgy brownie batter evenly in the lined pan with an offset spatula or your greased hands.",
    "Pop the brownies in the oven and bake until they get a nice crust and your house smells like brownies, 30 to 35 minutes. Let them cool completely on a rack or a dishtowel on your counter.",
    "While the brownies are cooling make the buttercream and ganache.",
    "For the buttercream: Mix your peanut butter and butter together in a stand mixer until they are totally blended. Turn your mixer down and slowly add your powdered sugar and fine sea salt. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl. Turn your mixer back to medium, add your milk and vanilla and keep mixing until it's fully blended. Dollop the peanut butter buttercream in heaping spoonfuls on top of the cooled brownies. Evenly spread it with the back of a butter knife the over the surface. Scatter the peanuts evenly over the buttercream, pressing into the buttercream so that the ganache has something to hold on to and the peanuts are all covered.",
    "For the ganache: Melt the chocolate chips and butter together in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly. Allow the ganache to cool down slightly for 10 minutes or so, then pour it evenly over the peanut butter buttercream layer. Smooth the ganache out with the back of a butter knife, making sure to cover the buttercream and peanuts completely. Chill the brownies in the refrigerator until the toppings are set, 1 1/2 hours or so.",
    "Remove these delicious guys from the refrigerator. Lift up the ends of the foil liner and place the Fudgy Salty Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownies on a cutting board. Cut into squares. Enjoy!"

The sugar must not be scorched, which is easy to do if you let the flame linger in one location. Use as hot and large a flame as practicable so you can caramelize the sugar in short order and not \"melt\" the custard underneath.",

Rather than just using 1 packet, use 2 packets of the beef flavor ramen noodles. When cooking the noodles, cook them without the flavoring. During this time, (after you drain the ground beef) add the veggies to the meat and continue to cook. As the veggies become cooked, add the two packets of flavoring to the beef-veggie mixture. The ramen noodles don't take long to cook, so be sure to watch them. When they are done, drain them, and add them to the beef-veggie mixture. The completed dish will have more flavor, and more noodles for the noodle lovers! Enjoy!"

    "Note 2: I have an older, smaller crock pot. The above times work perfectly for me. But if you have a newer or bigger crock pot, you may need to revise times downward, esp. after the bbq sauce is added. I think you need at least a couple of hours for it all to meld, but that may be all you need. Update: I recently bought a bigger crockpot, I think 5 or 6 qts. I cooked a 6 lb pork shoulder in it for 8 hours and it was shreddable at that point. Shredded, added the sauce, and cooked for another hour or so to meld everything. So use your best judgment on timing!",
    "Note3: You might want to turn your roast over after it's cooked a while, to ensure more even cooking. I think this may depend on the size and shape of your roast and the size of your slow cooker. Remember that each time you remove the lid you lose heat and be careful, as turning a large piece of meat is awkward.",

    "NOTE:  The success of this cooking method will depend upon how accurate the temperature of your oven is and how well your oven retains heat.  Adjust cooking time +/- according to your individual oven.",
    "NOTICE: If you have a very old oven that is not well insulated, this recipe may not work for you, as heat retention/residual heat is important to the success of this recipe.",
    "Determine the EXACT weight of roast from the meat wrapper.  Weight will determine how long to cook the roast.",
    "Preheat oven to 500 degrees.  Remove tenderloin from refrigerator.  Season meat as desired.  Place seasoned meat in an uncovered roasting pan on a shelf in the bottom 1/3 of your oven.",
    "IF YOU HAVE AN OVEN PROBE OR THERMOMETER THAT HAS A WIRE THAT GOES THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE OVEN DOOR, BY ALL MEANS USE IT AND SET THE TEMPERATURE ALARM FOR 140 DEGREES.  REMOVE MEAT FROM OVEN WHEN ALARM ALERT GOES OFF (probably before an hour has expired).",
    "Turn oven OFF and DO NOT open oven door for 45 to 1 hour, OR sooner IF you are using a probe thermometer and it alerts that internal meat temp is at 140 degrees.  Remove pork from oven, lightly cover with foil, and let rest 5-10 minutes to redistribute internal juices.  Roast should be done, very slightly pink in the center, and very moist.",
    "After resting 10 minutes, the roast should reach a safe 145-150 degrees.",
    "NOTE:******* For anyone questioning this method of cooking, it really does reach the proper internal temperature on a thermometer.  According to Sara Moulton on FoodTV, trichinosos is killed at 138 degrees, and 145 is a safe temperature for pork, although the USDA recommends 160 degrees (meat will be much drier).  If the center of the meat is not a little pink, it is overcooked!",
    "VARIATION:  To make Roasted Veggies along with the tenderloin, peel carrots and potatoes, and cut into about 1-inch cubes.   Season as desired and drizzle with a little oil.  Add vegetables to pan around (but NOT touching) pork tenderloin.  Cook tenderloin as instructed above.  The roasted potatoes and carrots should be done when the roast is done.  You may need to adjust the size of the potatoes and carrots depending upon the weight of your tenderloin and how long you cook it."

Then she removes the pork to be shredded and in the same pot cooks her noodles and then adds pork back.",

Personally I like Charlotte's idea with the celery and onions and now saute the onions in butter, along with about an equal amount of chopped celery until tender. That way you never have to worry about the onions getting done enough.",
    "As for the pasta, we personally prefer egg noodles over macaroni in this. Sometimes I just use whatever I have, sometimes a mix of several different pastas.",
    "If you don't like cooking with the cream of mushroom soup, of course you can substitute cream of chicken or celery soup, and if you don't want soup in it at all, you can substitute sour cream or cream cheese and it's also good, but if you don't use the cream of soup I would suggest adding as much of the tuna water as possible to keep that great tuna flavor.",
    "I prefer the tuna in water, and use as much of the tuna water as I can because I think it has a good flavor. Just use your own best judgement as to a good consistency, as this recipe is hard to mess up. Sometimes we don't always eat when I plan to and it stays in the oven a little longer than I'd like, so if yours seems too dry to you just add a little milk. You also can omit the bread crumbs/butter on top if you prefer, I usually do.",
    "And I almost always double the tuna (or even add more), just because tuna is good for you and we love tuna casserole."

    "Note: This batch of dough makes enough for sixteen 1/4 pound portions.  Each 1/4 pound portion will make 2 pieces of naan, 1 pizza crust, or 1 flatbread.",
    "On baking day  --  punch down a 1/4 pound portion of dough and divide into two equal balls. Using a rolling-pin, roll each piece of dough into an oval shape. The dough should be about 6-8 inches long and about 1/4-inch thick, but no thinner. Repeat this method with the rest of the dough, or as much as you'd like to make.",
    "Warm a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat (you want a hot pan). Brush both sides of the naan with olive oil or clarified butter.  Place the Naan on the hot skillet, cover and bake for 1 minute, until you see bubbles starting to form. Flip and cook for 1-2 minutes on the other side until large toasted spots appear on the underside. Place the naan in a tea towel-lined dish.",

    "The day before you want to make the rolls, make the brioche dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix the flour, granulated sugar, and salt on low speed to combine. Add the yeast and mix to combine, 10-15 seconds more. Add the eggs and milk and mix for 4 minutes. The dough should form a sticky, shaggy ball around the hook.",

(If you add the butter too quickly, it can create a greasy disaster in the bowl, so pace it out.) Scrape the bowl down once or twice to make sure everything is homogenous. (This mixing period is called intense mixing – and it is! Don’t be alarmed if the mixing is noisy or difficult in the early to mid stages, it will come together.) Then knead the dough (in the machine) until it is smooth and uniform, 1 minute more.",

    "Position the dough so that one of the long sides is facing you. Fold the left edge over toward the center, about three quarters of the way over the dough. Fold the right edge one quarter of the way over the dough and make sure it meets and doughs the left edge. The dough will now look somewhat like an open book with an off center spine. Fold the larger side over the smaller side. You will now have 4 layers of dough. If the dough feels soft or sticky, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 10-15 minutes – if not, proceed.",
    "Roll out the dough again to a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick and about 20x12 inches (though no need to be precise). Brush the surface of the dough with melted butter and sprinkle another 2 tablespoons of sugar over the dough. Position the dough so that one of the long sides is facing you. Fold the left edge of the dough one third of the way over the dough. Do the same with the right edge, resting it on top of the piece you just folded over, as though you were folding a letter to fit into a business envelope. You will now have 3 layers of dough. If the dough feels soft or sticky, wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 10-15 minutes – if not, proceed.",

    "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a 1/2 inch thick rectangle, about 12x20 inches. Cut the dough lengthwise into 16 even strips. Tightly roll each strip up into a spiral and place it, spiral side up, in a cup in one of the prepared muffin pans. Cover the pan with greased plastic wrap and let the rolls rise until they appear puffy, 30-45 minutes.",

Bake, rotating the sheets from front to bake and top to bottom at the halfway mark, until the rolls are evenly golden brown all over and the internal temperature reads 190 degrees Fahrenheit on a thermometer – about 25-33 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes in the pan before unmolding and serving.",
    "Citrus Faux-Laminated Brioche Buns: After you mix the dough, mix ¾ cup granulated sugar with the zest of two oranges - let sit, covered, overnight. Use this in place of the maple sugar in the recipe. In step 8, lightly grease a 9x9 inch pan. In step 9, cut the dough into 12 even strips. Roll the strips into spirals and place spiral side up in the prepared pan. Bake for 30-35 minutes.",
    "Vanilla-Bay Loaf: After you mix the dough, mix 3/4 cup granulated sugar with the seeds of 1 scraped vanilla bean and 2 finely crushed up bay leaves – let sit, covered, overnight. Use this in place of the maple sugar in the recipe. In step 8, lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In step 9, cut the dough into 1 inch cubes. Stack the cubes tightly in the prepared pan.

You can play with your oven temp and try them on 375 to keep them from spreading.  Adding more oil than called for will also cause the cookies to spread -- I wouldn't suggest it, they really don't need extra oil.",
    "Another way to keep them nice and thick and to get the most \"crinkled\" or \"crackled\" look is to make them bigger.  When I roll them at about 1.5 inches they look prettier.",

The last time I baked them, I rolled them into balls without rolling in the sugar and let them \"dry\" for a few minutes.  Then I rolled them in sugar and baked.  These came out with a nice coating of sugar that didn't disappear."

By giving these cookies away, you may need to be prepared for a marriage proposal on the spot. I have been baking since I was a little one. I was the only girl in a house full of brothers (5 to be exact), so I quickly found my spot in the kitchen. My love affair with baking started with cookies and it is how I won dates in high school by delivering them every Sunday night to my \"friends.\" Love would usually ensue. Now I find joy in baking them for my own 4 little ones and they are my ultimate taste testers in the quest for the perfect cookie. They say we got it years ago so it is about time to share it."

To marble, run a knife in a circular motion all around the batter in several concentric circles, going almost down to the bottom of the pan (don't overdo the marbling). With back of a large spoon, push batter slightly higher onto pan edges and tube, leaving a \"trench\" in the middle.",

If top of cake begins to become too brown, cover loosely with aluminum foil. Cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the crack that will form all around the top emerges with a few moist crumbs still clinging to it. Do not overbake! My experience with this cake is that it will pull away from the sides of the pan only after it is removed from the oven.",
    "Remove to cooling rack; allow to stand 15 to 20 minutes. Carefully loosen cake from pan edges and tube; invert onto another cooling rack (be careful! This is a large, tall cake). Re-invert to cool completely right side up. When completely cool, store airtight. Allow to stand at least overnight before serving. To cut, use a large, sharp, serrated knife."
