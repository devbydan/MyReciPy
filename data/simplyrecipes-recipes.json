Pulse the food processor until the ingredients clump together like little peas. Add the water and run the food processor for several seconds (about 8 to 10) until the dough comes together in large clumps.",
    "Shape the dough: Dump the dough on the parchment paper and pat it into a smooth ball. Press the dough into a disk, scatter flour lightly over the top, and roll out the dough into a circle that’s 13-inches in diameter (the width of the parchment paper). It doesn’t need to be perfect.",
    "Refrigerate the dough: Transfer the dough to a baking sheet and refrigerate while you prep the vegetables.",
    "Prep the vegetables: Peel and trim the carrots and cut into 1/3-inch-thick coins. Cut the fennel in half, trim out the small triangle of core, and cut into 1/3-inch-thick wedges. Peel and slice the onion in half. Then slice into 1/4-inch-thick half moons.",
    "Roast the vegetables: Pile carrots, fennel, and red onion onto a large baking sheet and drizzle with the olive oil. Season with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and black pepper. Roast until tender, about 30 minutes.",
    "Assemble Galette: Set the baking sheet with the chilled dough on your work surface. Use a spoon to arrange the roasted vegetables in the center, leaving a 2-inch border. Crumble the goat cheese over the vegetables and use your fingers to nestle some of the cheese into the vegetables.",
    "Form the dough: Gently fold the edges of the dough over the vegetables, pleating and pinching it to stay in place (the center will stay exposed). Use a pastry brush to lightly coat the top of the galette with egg white.",
    "Bake: Bake in the oven for 40-45 minutes until nicely browned and crisp.",
    "Enjoy: Serve warm from the oven or room temperature. Cut into wedges and serve."

    "Heat the sauce: Transfer the beans back to the large skillet set over low heat. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes at simmer. The sauce should be the texture of a thick soup. Add more water, if needed, to thin to the appropriate consistency.",

Submerge the tortilla in the bean sauce, smothering it completely. Use a spatula to fold it in half and transfer to a dinner plate.

Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Once the water comes to a rolling boil, turn the stove off and let the cinnamon stick steep for 10 minutes.",
    "Rinse the rice: While the cinnamon is steeping, give the rice a quick rinse under cold water. This will remove excess starch from the surface of the grains. Strain off any excess water before adding the rice to your blender.",
    "Blend the rice and cinnamon together: Pour the steeped cinnamon water, along with the cinnamon stick (or add the ground cinnamon), into the blender with the rice and the remaining 5 cups of water. Blend just until the grains of rice begin to break up, or about 1 minute.",
    "Transfer the rice water to a container: Pour most of the mixture into a large bowl. Swish around the remaining rice water in the blender carafe to try and remove any rice that may remain after the first pour. Add it to the container with the rest of the rice water. Try to retrieve as much of the rice as possible from the blender. Do not add fresh water to try and remove any remaining rice. It will dilute the flavor of your drink.",
    "Soak the rice: Allow the rice mixture to soak for at least 3 hours at room temperature. Stir the Horchata periodically throughout the soak time (I usually stir it on the hour, but that’s not a hard and fast rule).",
    "Strain the horchata: Set a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Place a layer of cheesecloth or a thin tea towel over the strainer. Pour the rice mixture through the lined strainer. Squeeze out any excess liquid from the rice then discard the solids.",
    "Sweeten the horchata: Transfer the strained rice liquid to a serving pitcher. Add the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract into the pitcher and whisk vigorously to break up the thick milk.",
    "Chill and serve: The horchata can now be served over ice, but I recommend chilling until very cold before pouring it over ice and enjoying. Drink as it is or add spiced rum!"

For medium rare doneness, cook steak until it reaches an internal temperature of 130oF. Work in two batches if needed.",

Use your dry hand to pack on the panko so it sticks well. Transfer breaded onion rings to a plate.",
    "Air fry the onion rings: Spray the air fryer basket and the onion rings with non-stick cooking spray. Place onion rings in a single layer in the basket. Air fry the onion rings at 350°F for 5 minutes, then flip the onion rings, and air fry for another 5 minutes on the second side. Remove onion rings and repeat until the rings are all air fried.",
    "Make the fry sauce: In a small bowl combine the mayo and ketchup to make the fry sauce.",
    "Serve the onion rings: Garnish onion rings with parsley, if desired and serve while warm. You can keep air fried onion rings in a 200˚F oven while you finish cooking the other batches. Serve onion rings with the fry sauce or your favorite ring dip."

    "Add the cheese: Reduce the heat to low and slowly, but continuously, whisk in both the cheddar and cream cheese for a full 10 minutes. The cheese will go from stringy to a smooth, velvety texture. It’s okay if minuscule bits of cream cheese remain; they’ll continue to melt as the sauce warms.",
    "Finish the queso dip: After whisking the cheese for 10 minutes, add the drained Rotel and chopped cilantro. Whisk to combine. It’s okay if the Rotel is a bit wet, this will help to thin the sauce.",
    "Top and serve: Once the vegetables are fully incorporated and warmed through, about 5 minutes, transfer the queso to a slow cooker. You can also serve it straight from the pan. Top with a generous serving of pico de gallo accompanied by warm corn tortilla chips or pretzel bites.",
    "Thin as needed: The queso will thicken as it sits. If you find it’s getting too thick, whisk in a couple of tablespoons of whole milk to thin it. Serve it straight from the pan kept over low heat on your stove or transfer the queso to a slow cooker set on warm. Stir the queso frequently to prevent a skin from forming on the surface of the dip."

    "Serve: Divide the rice between each bowl and then the salmon. Top with the rest of the sliced scallions, sliced cucumber, sliced radishes, diced avocado, furikake and red pepper flakes, if you like. The poke bowl is best enjoyed immediately."

  ],
  "directions": [
    "Prepare the mussels: In a large pot, pour in the wine or water and lemon juice. Add the mussels, cover the pot, and bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high heat. Watch the pan carefully because the liquid tends to spill out when it boils. Once boiling, lower the heat and cook the mussels for 2 minutes or until they open. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the mussels to a bowl. Discard any that are not open.",
    "Prepare the clams in the same pot: Add the clams to the cooking liquid, cover, and return to a boil. Lower the heat and cook the clams for 2 minutes or until they open. Set a colander over a bowl. Line the colander with a double layer of paper towels. Tip the clams and their liquid into the colander – this helps strain out any sand or grit. Save the cooking liquid. Discard any clams that are not open.",
    "Cook the potatoes in a separate pot: Combine the potatoes, a large pinch of salt, and water to cover in a separate pot. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and set on the cover askew. Simmer the potatoes for 8 minutes or until they are tender when pierced with a fork. Drain and set aside.",
    "Puree the tomatoes: In a blender, combine the tomatoes and their juice. Pulse until the mixture is coarsely pureed.",
    "Make the tomato broth: In the same pot used to cook the shellfish, heat the olive oil. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, red pepper, salt, and black pepper. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Pour in the chicken stock and the leftover liquid from cooking the mussels and clams. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and cover with the lid slightly ajar. Simmer for 10 minutes to reduce the broth and combine the flavors.",
    "Cook the fish: Add the fish pieces to the tomato broth; they should be not quite submerged. Cover the pot and cook for 5 minutes. The fish will be firm but not quite cooked through; it will finish cooking in the next steps.",
    "Add the cooked mussels, clams, lobster, and potatoes to the pot: Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of parsley over the fish, then add the mussels, clams, lobster meat, and cooked potatoes to the pot. Ladle some of the broth over top. Cover and cook for 2 minutes. Spoon more broth over top, cover, and continue cooking for 2 minutes more, or until all the shellfish is hot.",
    "Serve the stew: Divide the stew between bowls, making sure to get plenty of broth. Sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons parsley."

    "Sauté the onions: Heat the butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "Add the potatoes and garlic: Add the potatoes and cook another 1 to 2 minutes, then add the garlic and the chopped roasted peppers. Stir well and cook for 2 minutes.",
    "Add the stock and simmer: Add the stock, stir well and bring to a simmer. Cook over medium heat until potatoes are soft, about 12 to 15 minutes.",
    "Purée the soup: Purée the soup in a blender or food processor until very smooth. Fill the blender about halfway with the soup. Start the blender on low and keep your hand on the top, in case the lid wants to pop off from the rising steam. Once everything is well chopped, turn the blender to its highest setting and blend until smooth, about 1 minute. You might need to do this in batches.",
    "Add the cream, season to taste, and serve: Return to a clean pot set over low heat. Add the cream, stir well and taste. Add some cayenne, salt and pepper to taste."

  ],
  "directions": [
    "Prepare the turkey for brining: Remove the turkey from its package and pat dry. Remove the giblets and save for making gravy. Place the turkey in a large pot, brining bag, or other container large enough to keep the turkey submerged.",
    "Prepare the brine ingredients: Strip the peels from the oranges and lemons using a vegetable peeler. Try to remove just the peel, leaving behind as much of the bitter white pith as possible. Roughly chop the sage leaves. Make sure the bay leaves, peppercorns, and garlic cloves are measured out and ready to go. (Save the leftover oranges and lemons for stuffing the turkey during roasting!)",
    "Prepare the brine concentrate: Bring 1 quart (4 cups) of the water to a boil in a large saucepan or stock pot on the stovetop. Once boiling, add the salt and stir until dissolved. Add the orange and lemon peels, chopped sage, bay leaves, peppercorns, and garlic. Let the water return to a boil, then remove from heat.",
    "Cool and then dilute the concentrate to make the turkey brine: Let the brine concentrate and flavoring ingredients cool until no longer steaming, then stir in the remaining 3 quarts of water. (If your pan is too small, you can do this in a pitcher or other large container.) Check the temperature of the brine; it should be room temperature or lukewarm.",
    "Pour the brine over the turkey: Make sure the turkey is submerged, though it's ok if the boney tips of the legs stick out the top. If needed for larger turkeys, prepare additional brine solution (1/4 cup of salt dissolved in 4 cups of warm water) in order to cover the turkey. If the turkey is floating, weight it down with a plate or other heavy object.",
    "Brine for 12 to 24 hours: Cover the turkey and keep refrigerated during brining.",
    "Remove the turkey from the brine and rinse: When you're ready to begin roasting your turkey, remove it from the brine and rinse it with cool water. It's ok if the water is tinged pink. Pat dry.",
    "Roast the turkey as usual: There's no need to salt the turkey before roasting, but otherwise, roast the turkey as usual following your favorite recipe. If desired, stuff the cavity of the turkey with leftover sage and the peeled lemons and oranges from preparing the brine. Roasting time may be shortened; begin checking the temperature of the turkey halfway through roasting."

  "ingredients": [
    "1 tablespoon unsalted butter",
    "1 tablespoon all purpose-flour",
    "1 1/4 cups real whole milk",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin",
    "1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic",
    "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1/4 teaspoon onion powder",
    "1 pinch freshly ground black pepper",
    "10 ounces (about 4 cups) shredded white American cheese",
    "1 tablespoon diced canned green chiles or jalapeños, optional",
    "Fresh pico de gallo",
    "Chopped cilantro",
    "Sliced jalapeño peppers"
  ],
  "directions": [
    "Make the roux: In a 3-quart saucepan (preferably one with sloping sides) melt the butter over medium-low heat. Once the butter is completely melted, sprinkle the flour over it and whisk the two together until a very loose paste forms. Cook the roux for 1 minute.",
    "Make a béchamel sauce: Pour the milk into the roux in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly. Adding the milk to the roux slowly helps avoid clumps.",
    "Add the spices: Once all of the milk has been whisked into the pot, add the cumin, garlic, salt, onion powder, and black pepper. Whisk the spices in completely while bringing the milk up to a simmer.",
    "Thicken the sauce: Whisk the milk sauce frequently until small bubbles appear on the surface. This should take 3 to 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, the milk sauce should thicken to the consistency of a bisque or soup.",
    "Gradually whisk in the shredded cheese: Once the milk sauce has thickened, decrease the heat to the lowest setting. Whisk in the shredded cheese a heavy pinch at a time, adding the next batch of cheese only when the previous batch has melted completely.",
    "Stir in the chiles: Once all of the cheese has been whisked in, add the diced green chiles to the queso blanco. Taste the sauce, adding more salt if needed.",
    "Adjust the consistency: When first prepared, the sauce will be slightly thin. This is to allow the queso to thicken properly as it cools. If you find your queso is too thick, add more milk, a tablespoon at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency.",
    "Keep warm over very low heat: If you plan to serve the queso blanco over the span of a couple of hours, keep the dip warm over very low heat. Stir every 10 minutes to keep it smooth. If the top of the dip starts to firm up, simply stir to replenish its creamy consistency.",
    "Serve with pita or chips: and a glass of real milk!"

If it tastes flat, add another 1/2 to 1 teaspoon vinegar.",

Once the cream cheese is in pieces the size of a nickel or smaller, whisk the mixture until it’s homogeneous and thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes.",

    "Add the pasta to the sauce: Once the sauce is thick like heavy whipping cream and homogeneous, add the pasta. Stir to coat. It will look soupy. That’s what you want. Transfer the mixture to the buttered 8x8 pan. Smooth the top.",
    "Top with the panko and bake: Sprinkle the panko mixture over the top of the mac and cheese. Place in oven for 20 to 25 minutes until the top is golden brown and the cheese sauce is bubbling around the edges. Cool briefly before serving."

Gently lift and transfer it to a cutting board. Tear and sprinkle the basil leaves on top. Cut into wedges and serve."

    "Cook the French toast: Add the bread and fry for 4 to 6 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy on the edges; you may need to add more coconut oil after you flip the bread. If cooking in batches, transfer the French toast to a lined baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm, and repeat to fry the remaining bread, adding more coconut oil to cook each batch.",
    "While the last pieces of toast are cooking, make the caramelized bananas: Combine the banana slices and the coconut sugar in a zipper-lock bag, seal, and shake to coat evenly. In a skillet over medium-high heat, warm the coconut oil, add the coated bananas and the bourbon booster (if using), and fry for about 2 minutes on each side until nicely caramelized.",
    "To serve: Serve two slices of French toast on each plate, topped with one-quarter of the caramelized bananas, one-quarter of the crushed nut boosters, and one-quarter of the coconut booster. Pass maple syrup at the table."

    "Rinse the rice: Put the rice in a wire mesh sieve or strainer and rinse it under cold water for about 10 seconds. Swish it around to get the excess water off.",
    "Combine the rice and liquid: In a medium saucepan (about 2 quarts), combine the rice and water. Add the salt, if using.",
    "Cover and bring to a boil: Put on the lid. Turn the heat to medium-high and bring the rice to a boil. The liquid can quickly boil over and make a big mess, so watch the pot for steam, or listen for the lid making jiggling sounds.",
    "Turn down the heat and set the timer: Once the rice comes to a boil, set a timer for 35 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, or as low as it can go while still maintaining a very gently simmer (look for wisps of steam around the lid). It’s okay to take off the lid a few times to check on the progress of the rice, but try to keep it to a minimum.",
    "When the timer goes off, open the lid: Check on the doneness of the rice. You should see crater-like steam holes in the surface of the rice, and there should not be any liquid sloshing around in the bottom of the pot. If you taste a grain, it may be a little toothy, which is fine. If the rice is still outright crunchy, return it to the burner on medium-low in increments of 5 minutes.",
    "Turn off the burner and let the rice steam: Turn off the heat. Let the rice sit with the lid on for 10 minutes so it can steam. Even though the pot is not on the heat, this is part of your cooking time.",
    "Fluff and serve: Use a fork or spoon to fluff the rice before serving it.",
    "Freeze cooled leftovers, if you like: Brown rice freezes great! Put the cooled rice in a zip-top freezer bag. Press out as much air as you can, seal it, and freeze for up to 6 months. Defrost in the refrigerator overnight, or plunge the bag in a bowl of warm water and massage every few minutes to break up the grains. Here's more on freezing rice."

Use the handle of a spoon or fork to gently swirl each well and combine the filling with the egg mixture.",
    "Fill the muffin tin: Bake egg bites for 16 to 18 minutes, turning the muffin tin halfway through cooking to ensure they bake evenly. To test for doneness poke the center of an egg bite with your finger. It should be bouncy and just set, and the edges where the egg meets the muffin tin should be a pale golden brown. The egg bites will continue to set up as they cool.",
    "Bake the egg bites: Remove the cooked egg bites from the oven and run a butter knife around the edge of each well to release any stuck-on bits. Let cool for 5 to 10 minutes, then remove to a plate. Serve warm, or allow to cool to room temperature and then freeze or refrigerate.",

    "Cool and serve: Let the frittata cool for 5 minutes before cutting into wedges. Leftover frittata will keep for up to a week in the refrigerator; eat cold or briefly warmed in the microwave."

    "Remove any pin bones from the salmon: Place the salmon flesh side up on a cutting board. With your fingertips, feel along the flesh to see if there are any fine pin bones. Use tweezers, a strawberry huller, or another pincher to gently pull them out.",
    "Mix the curing mixture: In a bowl, combine the salt, brown and granulated sugar, and fennel seeds. Mix well.",
    "Sprinkle half salmon with half curing mixture: Sprinkle some of the curing mixture down the middle of a 12-inch glass or ceramic baking dish and sprinkle some of the dill on top. Set one of the pieces of salmon, skin side down, on top of the salt mixture. Sprinkle half the remaining salt mixture and half of the remaining dill over the flesh of the fish. Press lightly so the mixture sticks.",
    "Set the other piece of salmon, skin side up, on top of the first piece: Lay the second piece so that the thicker part of the top piece sits on the thinner part of the bottom piece, forming flat, even rectangle. Sprinkle the remaining salt mixture and dill over the top.",
    "Cover and press the salmon: Cover the whole dish with plastic wrap. Set another, smaller baking dish on top of the salmon and weight it down with two heavy cans, a garden brick, or any other heavy weight.",
    "Refrigerate and cure for 2 days: Flip the fish after 24 hours, so that the top piece is now on the bottom. This helps the fish cure evenly.",
    "Rinse the curing mixture off the gravlax: When ready to serve, remove the fish from the baking dish. Some liquid will have collected on the bottom; this is normal. Rinse the fish well with cold water, rubbing off the curing mixture with your fingers. Dry the fish well with paper towels.",
    "Slice the gravlax: Set one of the pieces of fish, skin side down, on a cutting board. Using a very sharp knife, slice the fish as thinly as you possibly can while holding the blade at an extreme diagonal. Do the same with the other piece of fish.",
    "Serve the gravlax: Arrange the slices overlapping on a platter, curling them as you set them down. Sprinkle with red onion, capers, and remaining dill, and garnish with lemon. Leftovers will keep for about a week."

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone mat, or lightly butter a baking sheet. Lightly flour a clean surface and roll out the pie dough to a 13-inch round of even thickness.",

Arrange the plum slices in a circular pattern, starting from 1 1/2 to 2 inches from the outside edge of the dough, working your way into the center. Fold the edges of the pie crust up and over so that circle of the filling is visible.",

    "Bake: Place in the middle rack of the oven. Bake at 375°F (190°C) for 40-50 minutes, until the crust is lightly browned and the filling is bubbly. Cool on a rack for an hour before serving."

    "Press the peanut butter mixture into pan: Press the peanut butter mixture into the bottom of your lined pan in an even layer. You can use the flat bottom of a measuring cup, small saucepan, or smaller baking pan to press on the mixture to help make the surface more even.",
    "Melt the chocolate chips: Place a metal bowl over a saucepan with simmering water (not boiling, but gently simmering). Place the chocolate chips and butter into the bowl. Melt the chocolate chips, stirring occasionally, until smooth.",
    "Spread the chocolate: Spread the melted chocolate evenly over the peanut butter layer in the pan. (An offset spatula is a good tool for this.) Refrigerate for at least an hour.",
    "Cut into bars: Lift the contents from the pan onto a cutting board. Cut into 36 bars, 1-inch by 2 1/4 inches."

If the dough is still sticking to the sides after few minutes of kneading, add in a little more flour 2 tablespoons at a time.",

    "Shape the dough into rolls: Line a 13x9-inch baking pan with parchment paper and lightly grease. Turn the dough the out onto lightly floured surface and cut into 16 to 20 equal pieces. Roll the dough into small balls, and place seam side down in the baking dish.",
    "Cover and let the rolls rise until puffed and nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour: About 15 minutes before the rolls are ready, heat the oven to 350F.",
    "Bake for the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes: or until the rolls are golden brown on top and register 200F on the inside when tested with an instant-read thermometer.",
    "Brush the rolls with honey butter: In a small dish, mix together 1/4 cup room temperature butter and 2 tablespoons honey until smooth. Brush tops of baked rolls with mixture, then sprinkle with salt. Allow to cool slightly before serving."

    "Brown the beef chunks in bacon fat: Increase heat to medium high, add back in 1 tablespoon of bacon fat. Working in batches so that you don't crowd the beef (crowding will steam cook the meat instead of browning it), brown the beef cubes on all sides, lightly salting as you cook the beef. Remove beef from pan, set aside.",

    "Combine the chili ingredients in a big pot, simmer, then cook slowly: Into a 6-quart, thick-bottomed Dutch oven, put onion-chili mixture, beef, bacon, tomatoes (break up the whole tomatoes with your fingers as you put them in the pot), water, lime juice and sugar. Heat the chili on medium high heat until it comes to a simmer. Then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 1 1/2 hours. Then uncover and cook for another half hour, keeping the temperature at a place where you can maintain a simmer.",
    "Thicken with cornstarch: Mix the cornstarch powder into a little water to dissolve the corn starch (otherwise you'll have lumps to deal with) and add to the chili to thicken it.",
    "Add the kidney beans: Gently mix in the kidney beans. Add salt to taste. Adjust seasonings. Depending on the acidity of the tomatoes and lime juice you may need a little more sugar to bring the stew to balance. At this point you can also add a little more chili powder if you desire more heat.",
    "Add toppings to serve: Sprinkle with grated cheddar cheese and chopped red onion. Serve with cornbread, tortilla chips, and/or rice."

Pour the remaining 1 cup of cream into a medium size metal bowl, set in ice water (with lots of ice) over a larger bowl. Set a mesh strainer on top of the bowls. Set aside.",
    "Strain out the mint leaves, add sugar: Strain the milk cream mixture into a separate bowl, pressing against the mint leaves with a rubber spatula in a sieve to get the most liquid out of them. Return the milk cream mixture to the saucepan. Add sugar and salt to the mixture. Heat until just steaming again, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Remove from heat.",
    "Temper the egg yolks with hot milk cream: Whisk the egg yolks in a medium sized bowl. Slowly pour the heated milk cream mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly so that the egg yolks are tempered by the warm mixture, but not cooked by it. Scrape the warmed egg yolks back into the saucepan.",
    "Heat until the mixture begins to thicken: Return the saucepan to the stove, stirring the mixture constantly over medium heat with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom as you stir, until the mixture thickens and coats the spoon so that you can run your finger across the coating and have the coating not run. This can take about 10 minutes.",
    "Strain the custard mixture into cream in ice bath: Pour the custard through the strainer (from step 2) and stir into the cold cream to stop the cooking.",
    "Chill completely: Chill the mixture thoroughly in the refrigerator (at least a couple of hours) or stir the mixture in the bowl placed over the ice bath until thoroughly chilled (20 minutes or so).",
    "Process in the ice cream maker: Process the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Add the chopped chocolate: Once the ice cream has been made in the ice cream maker it should be pretty soft. Gently fold in the finely chopped chocolate.",
    "Chill in the freezer: Put in an airtight container and place in the freezer for at least an hour, preferably several hours. If it has been frozen for more than a day, you may need to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften it before serving."

  "directions": [
    "Prepare the dough: Before starting the lattice top, roll out half of your pie dough and line your pie dish with it. The dough should extend beyond the rim of the pie dish by about 1/2 inch. Put it in the refrigerator to chill while you work on the lattice. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the other half of your pie dough to the same extent as the first half (about 3 inches beyond the diameter of your pie dish). It's easier to work with the dough if it is chilled, so if it the dough has softened too much, put the rolled-out piece on a flat cookie sheet and chill it in the refrigerator or freezer for a few minutes.",
    "Cut the dough into even strips: Cut the dough into even strips, 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch wide, depending on how thick you want your lattice strips. You can use a blunt knife with or without a ruler or straight edge to guide you, or you can use a pizza wheel or a pastry wheel if you have one.",
    "Fill your pie, lay down the strips: Fill your pie shell with the pie filling. Lay out 4 to 7 parallel strips of the pie dough, depending on how thick your strips are, on top of the filling, with about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch space between them. Fold back every other strip.",
    "Start weaving the cross strips: Place one long strip of dough perpendicular to the parallel strips as shown. Unfold the folded strips over the perpendicular strip.",
    "Fold and weave parallel strips: Now take the parallel strips that are running underneath the perpendicular strip and fold them back over the perpendicular strip, as shown. Lay down a second perpendicular strip of dough next to the first strip, with some space between the strips. Unfold the folded parallel strips over the second strip.",
    "Continue weaving and finish: Continue this process until the weave is complete over the top of the pie.",
    "Trim the dough and crimp the edges: Trim the edges of the strips flush with the dough of the underlying pie dish, which should be about half an inch over the sides. Fold back the rim of the shell over the edge of the lattice strips, and crimp to secure.",
    "Bake until browned: Bake pie as directed in your recipe. Let cook for at least an hour before serving."

Watch the corn closely so that you can remove it from the water the second it’s done cooking.",

    "Fill the ramekins: Cover ramekins with a top piece of pie crust, either store-bought or homemade. Crimp the edges well and poke a few holes in the center of the pie crust to let steam escape. Whisk egg and water to make an egg wash. Brush on pie crust.",
    "Cover with pie crust and brush with egg wash: Bake the turkey pot pies at 350 ̊F for 20-25 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown around the edges and in the center. Let the pot pies cool for a few minutes before serving.",
    "Bake the pot pies: Leftover pot pie will keep well in the fridge for up to five days. Reheat them in a 350°F oven until warmed through and piping hot."

Stir gently to make sure ingredients are distributed evenly. The thighs should only be submerged halfway in the liquid so the skin stays crispy while baking.",
    "Add the remaining ingredients: Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook for 30-35 minutes, or until sweet potatoes are fork-tender and the chicken is cooked through. (It should reach at least 165 ̊F in the thickest part.) It’s very hard to overcook chicken thighs in this environment, so don’t worry if they register much hotter than that.",
    "Cook the chicken thighs in the oven: Divide the chicken thighs between four plates and add cooked rice or orzo to the side, which is great for soaking up the juices. Spoon sweet potatoes and onions on top.",
    "Serve the chicken thighs: Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 4-5 days. To reheat, microwave the thighs for about 90 seconds on high. To regain some of the crispiness, reheat the thighs in the oven until warmed through."

    "Prepare the shrimp: Peel and devein shrimp if necessary. Then skewer shrimp on soaked bamboo skewers. Six shrimp per skewer is a good amount. Season shrimp liberally with seafood rub—you won’t use all of it.",
    "Oil the grill and grill the shrimp: Fold up a thick wad of paper towels. Using tongs, dip the paper towels in oil and rub the grill grates. Add the shrimp skewers to the freshly oiled grill grates. Cook for 2 minutes per side until they are just cooked through and have a few grill marks.",
    "Cook the couscous: In a small pot set over medium-high heat, bring water and butter to a simmer. When butter is melted, stir in couscous and remove from heat and cover with a lid. Let steam for five minutes to cook couscous. Then stir in lemon pepper and fresh lemon zest.",
    "Make the Swiss chard (optional Dad Add): Add olive oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil shimmers, add Swiss chard and cook, stirring occasionally until Swiss chard wilts down—this should only take a couple of minutes. Add lemon juice and salt, toss to coat, and keep warm over low heat until ready to serve.",
    "Serve: Shrimp and couscous are best to serve right away. If you have leftovers, reheat shrimp in a skillet over low heat until warmed through. Do not microwave. Shrimp will keep in the fridge for a few days."

    "Poach the calamari rings: Bring the broth to a boil once more. Add the calamari rings and boil 30 seconds to 1 minute, then pour the contents of the pot into a strainer set over a bowl. You can save the broth or discard it. Pick out all the calamari rings and add to the bowl.",
    "Dress the salad: To finish, add the olive oil and a little salt and half the lemon juice. Mix well and taste. Add more olive oil, lemon and salt until you get the flavors you want: The salad should be glistening with oil, briny and tart with lemon. Finally, mix in the chives and chill. This salad is better a few hours after it's made."
